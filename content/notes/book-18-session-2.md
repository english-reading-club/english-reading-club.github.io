## Notes

> Midwifing changed my mother. She was a grown woman with seven children, but this was the first time in her life that she was, without question or caveat, the one in charge. Sometimes, in the days after a birth, I detected in her something of Judy’s heavy presence, in a forceful turn of her head, or the imperious arch of an eyebrow. She stopped wearing makeup, then she stopped apologizing for not wearing it.

- At the beginning, very exhausted
- acted as an assistant
- acted as a midwife herself
- income/money to afford the telephone
- not so boring, help people
- cheaper but illegal
- only in charge

- Offered such a job under such circumstances, accept or not?
- age: 30 or 40 year-old?
- 7 children, baby

- Her father really force her mother to work 
- As long as we have income, then nobody can force us
- hesitated to make a change
- Every child is different
- stable
- She worked a housewife
- Why did she married such a kind of guy?


- 妇产科 （Obstetrics and Gynecology） vs . Mid wife
