# Notes

## Scenario 1

Your kid is attending a chess class. 

There is an upcoming chess contest in three days. Only two kids are selected by the teacher to compete in the contest and yours is one of the them. In the parents chat group, The teacher is announcing the cancellation of the next class due to that he/she will take the two kids to the contest. The parents of other kids complain and protest that it is unfair for the teacher to make such a decision on his/her own without even informing them, and why won't their kids be able to enter the contest. In respond to the complaint, the teacher asks the parents of the chosen kids to make explanation. It seems there is a crucial conversation ahead, how would you react? Would you clam up or say something? If you are gonna say something, how do you pacify the emotion of other parents and maintain a good relationship with the teacher as well?


## Scenario 2: When Your Supervisor Goes Back on Their Word 

A little over a year ago I was promoted at work and presented with two options, one of which entailed leading a scientific program that I had spent more than two years developing with my supervisor. I declined the other choice because of the opportunity to lead this exciting new program. 

Shortly after I declined the other option, my supervisor pulled a 180. She decided to lead the program herself for at least a year. Since the other option had now been filled, I was stuck. I decided to make the best of the situation. Fast forward a year and I am still trapped in a supporting role. I have the experience and knowledge to lead this program, but I can’t seem to get my supervisor to let go. How do I gently broach this conversation with her? I worry that if I broach it poorly, she may unconsciously penalize me on performance ratings that would impact my future career development.

### Scenario 3: When You’re Bored in One-on-Ones with Employees

I have an employee who tends to talk a lot and drift off topic in our one-on-one meetings, to the point where I can’t focus. I have tried to keep them on track, but it is very difficult. They often take up an hour instead of the scheduled 30 minutes, and I completely lose track of what they are saying. I try hard not to look bored (thankfully we are wearing masks so they can’t see my expression). I even structured the meeting by providing discussion points in advance, but this still hasn’t helped. I find myself consistently saying things like “Let’s get back on track, “What can I do to help you?” and “How can this be applied to your work?” I’m concerned that I’m getting distracted because I’m bored. Please help.
