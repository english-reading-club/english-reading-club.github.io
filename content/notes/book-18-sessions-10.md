## Chapter 19: In the beginning

[Summary & Analysis](https://www.litcharts.com/lit/educated/chapter-19-in-the-beginning)

Do you think Tara had some difficulties with her relationship with Charles?

> The next week, [Tara](https://www.litcharts.com/lit/educated/characters/tara-westover) drives to the nearest Walmart and buys some women’s clothing. 

> “We arrived at his house. Charles turned on the TV and settled onto the sofa; I perched lightly on one side. The lights dimmed, the opening credits rolled. Charles inched toward me, slowly at first, then more confidently, until his leg brushed mine. In my mind I bolted, I ran a thousand miles in a single heartbeat. In reality I merely flinched. Charles flinched, too—I’d startled him. I repositioned myself, driving my body into the sofa arm, gathering my limbs and pressing them away from him. I held that unnatural pose for perhaps twenty seconds, until he understood, hearing the words I couldn’t say, and moved to the floor.”

- Tara learned something from her roommate
- She is not satatified with herself.
- Common sense is not common sense.
- Sugguestion for girls: Keep smiling and don't say anything.

> Though Charles deeply cares for Tara, she’s unable to move their  relationship to the next level out of fears, insecurities, and  self-hating behaviors instilled in her by years of emotional and verbal  abuse at the hands of Gene and Shawn. 

## Chapter 20: Recitals of the Fathers

[Summary & Analysis](https://www.litcharts.com/lit/educated/chapter-20-recitals-of-the-fathers)

> [Charles](https://www.litcharts.com/lit/educated/characters/charles) is [Tara](https://www.litcharts.com/lit/educated/characters/tara-westover)’s first real, true friend from “that other world”—the world her [father](https://www.litcharts.com/lit/educated/characters/gene-westover-dad) has been trying to “protect” her from all her life.

> Shawn begins calling Tara horrible nicknames like “wench,” “Wilbur,” and “nigger.” None of these nicknames are new, but now that Tara has been  to college and learned about the history of slavery, Jim Crow,  segregation, and racism in America, she is particularly upset by Shawn’s casual use of the word “nigger.”

- How ignorant
- Only my ears are different
