They used the word “professional.” I didn’t know what that meant until one Sunday when Mary played a piano solo for the congregation. The music stopped my breath. I’d heard the piano played countless times before, to accompany hymns, but when Mary played it, the sound was nothing like that formless clunking. It was liquid, it was air. It was rock one moment and wind the next.</p><p>The next day, when Mary returned from the school, I asked her if instead of money she would give me lessons. We perched on the piano bench and she showed me a few finger exercises. Then she asked what else I was learning besides the piano. Dad had told me what to say when people asked about my schooling. “I do school every day,” I said.”</p></blockquote><h3 id=dancing>Dancing</h3><blockquote><p>“She’d misunderstood. She thought I didn’t have money. “It isn’t modest,” I said. Her lips parted in surprise. These Californian Moyles, I thought.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“The other girls rarely spoke to me, but I loved being there with them. I loved the sensation of conformity. Learning to dance felt like learning to belong. I could memorize the movements and, in doing so, step into their minds, lunging when they lunged, reaching my arms upward in time with theirs. Sometimes, when I glanced at the mirror and saw the tangle of our twirling forms, I couldn’t immediately discern myself in the crowd. It didn’t matter that I was wearing a gray T-shirt—a goose among swans. We moved together, a single flock.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“The music ended. The girls glared at me as we left the stage—I had ruined the performance—but I could barely see them. Only one person in that room felt real to me, and that was Dad. I searched the audience and recognized him easily. He was standing in the back, the lights from the stage flickering off his square glasses. His expression was stiff, impassive, but I could see anger in it.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“The rest of the night was taken up by my father’s lecture. He said Caroline’s class was one of Satan’s deceptions, like the public school, because it claimed to be one thing when really it was another. It claimed to teach dance, but instead it taught immodesty, promiscuity. Satan was shrewd, Dad said. By calling it “dance,” he had convinced good Mormons to accept the sight of their daughters jumping about like whores in the Lord’s house. That fact offended Dad more than anything else: that such a lewd display had taken place in a church.
”</p></blockquote><h3 id=singing>Singing</h3><blockquote><p>“MOTHER MUST HAVE FELT guilty after the recital, because in the weeks that followed she searched for something else I could do, something Dad wouldn’t forbid. She’d noticed the hours I spent in my room with Tyler’s old boom box, listening to the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, so she began looking for a voice teacher. It took a few weeks to find one, and another few weeks to persuade the teacher to take me. The lessons were much more expensive than the dance class had been, but Mother paid for them with the money she made selling oils.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“Mother played the introduction. The music paused; it was time to sing. I might have had any number of thoughts at that moment. I might have thought of my teacher and her techniques—square stance, straight back, dropped jaw. Instead I thought of Tyler, and of lying on the carpet next to his desk, staring at his woolen-socked feet while the Mormon Tabernacle Choir chanted and trilled. He’d filled my head with their voices, which to me were more beautiful than anything except Buck’s Peak.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“Dad smiled at everyone. There was scarcely a person in the church that Dad hadn’t called a gentile—for visiting a doctor or for sending their kids to the public school—but that day he seemed to forget about California socialism and the Illuminati. He stood next to me, a hand on my shoulder, graciously collecting compliments. “We’re very blessed,” he kept saying. “Very blessed.” Papa Jay crossed the chapel and paused in front of our pew. He said I sang like one of God’s own angels. Dad looked at him for a moment, then his eyes began to shine and he shook Papa Jay’s hand like they were old friends.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“I’ll find the money,” he told Mother when they went to bed that night. “You get her to that audition.”</p></blockquote><p><a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/educated/chapter-8-tiny-harlots target=_blank>Chapter Summary & Analysis</a></p><h2 id=chapter-9-perfect-in-his-generation>Chapter 9: Perfect in His Generation</h2><h1 id=next-session>Next session</h1><ul><li>Homework: Finish the 2nd chapter</li><li>Host Volunteer: foo</li></ul><aside class="related layout__related"><h2>See also</h2><ul><li><a href=/notes/book-18-sessions-4/>Book 18 Sessions 4</a></li><li><a href=/notes/book-18-session-3/>Book 18 Session 3</a></li><li><a href=/notes/book-18-session-2/>Book 18 Session 2</a></li></ul></aside><p class=content-dates>Updated: 26 May, 2021<br>Created: 26 May, 2021</p></div></article></main><aside class="sidebar layout__second-sidebar"><section><h4 class=menu><a href=/notes/ class=active aria-current=page>Notes</a></h4><ul class=menu><li><a href=/notes/book-18-sessions-5/ class=active aria-current=page>Book 18 Sessions 5</a></li><li><a href=/notes/book-18-sessions-4/>Book 18 Sessions 4</a></li><li><a href=/notes/book-18-session-3/>Book 18 Session 3</a></li><li><a href=/notes/book-18-session-2/>Book 18 Session 2</a></li><li><a href=/notes/book-18-session-1/>Book 18 Session 1</a></li><li><a href=/notes/book-17-session-7/>Book 17 Session 7</a></li><li><a href=/notes/book-17-session-6/>Book 17 Session 6</a></li><li><a href=/notes/book-17-session-5/>Book 17 Session 5</a></li><li><a href=/notes/book-17-session-4/>Book 17 Session 4</a></li><li><a href=/notes/book-17-session-3/>Book 17 Session 3</a></li><li><a href=/notes/book-17-session-2/>Book 17 Session 2</a></li><li><a href=/notes/book-17-session-1/>Book 17 Session 1</a></li><li><a href=/notes/book-16-practice-session-2/>Book 16 Practice Session 2</a></li><li><a href=/notes/book-16-practice-session-1/>Book 16 Practice Session 1</a></li><li><a href=/notes/book-16-chapter-13/>Book 17 Chapter 13</a></li><li><a href=/notes/book-16-chapter-12/>Book 16 Chapter 12</a></li><li><a href=/notes/book-16-chapter-11/>Chapter 11: The Four Life Areas - Book 16: The 90 Day Life</a></li></ul></section><section><h4 class=menu><a href=/news/>News</a></h4><ul class=menu><li><a href=/news/voting-may-2021/>Vote for Upcoming Books - May 2021</a></li><li><a href=/news/book-18-candidates/>Book 18 Candidates</a></li><li><a href=/news/2020-club-summary/>2020 Yearly Summary​ (Shanghai)​</a></li><li><a href=/news/club-shelf-library/>Club Shelf (Library)</a></li><li><a href=/news/book-16-two-practice-sessions/>Agenda for our next (also the last) two sessions: Pracice</a></li><li><a href=/news/book-17-candidates/>Book 17 Candidates</a></li></ul></section></aside><footer class="footer layout__footer"><p>This site is licensed under a <a href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/>Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a>.</p><p>Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>, <a href=https://github.com/jizusun/hugo-theme-zen>fork of Zen theme</a> and <a href=https://github.com/english-reading-club/english-reading-club.github.io/actions/workflows/main.yml><img src=https://github.com/english-reading-club/english-reading-club.github.io/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg alt></a></p></footer></div><div class=mobile-nav dir=ltr><div class=mobile-nav__cover></div><a href=#navigation class=mobile-nav__toggle aria-haspopup=true role=button>Menu</a><div class=mobile-nav__sheet><div class=mobile-nav__region></div><nav class=mobile-nav__main-menu><h2 class=visually-hidden>Main menu</h2><ul class=mobile-nav__navbar><li><a href=/>Home</a></li><li><a href=/about/>About</a></li><li><a href=/search/>Search</a></li><li><a href=/notes/ class=active aria-current=page>Notes</a></li><li><a href=/news/>News</a></li></ul></nav></div></div></body></html>
