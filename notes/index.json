The two women chatted in the kitchen, Judy perched on a barstool, Mother leaning across the counter, her head resting lazily in her hand. I took the list of herbs to the storeroom. Maria, lugging a different baby, followed. I pulled dried leaves and clouded liquids from the shelves, all the while gushing about Mother’s exploits, finishing with the confrontation in the hospital.

His mother had walked out years before, leaving his dad to cope with Adrian and his sister. This was long before the term ‘single-parent family’ came into use; back then it was ‘a broken home’, and Adrian was the only person we knew who came from one. This ought to have given him a whole storetank of existential rage, but somehow it didn’t; he said he loved his mother and respected his father. Privately, the three of us examined his case and came up with a theory: that the key to a happy family life was for there not to be a family – or at least, not one living together.

Press a key or wait a few seconds to continue starting up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYesterday, in a WeChat group, we had such a great fun blaming and teasing the IT services in our company. Our IT installed various software to secure our computers, but it ended up making them crappy. Computers sometimes become unresponsive, sometimes even crashed. Crashed like a dog!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I have to say, it is NOT our IT services to be blamed. The computer is such a complicated system, no matter it is a Windows laptop, a MacBook, or a Linux box, that the crash happened because of various root causes. Perhaps it\u0026rsquo;s a bug of the underlying operating system, perhaps it\u0026rsquo;s a compatibility problem that is brought by the applications you or the IT services just installed, 0r perhaps it\u0026rsquo;s just because your computer is in a bad mood! God knows!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut even if the computer crashes from time to time, you cannot give it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou need to face it! You just give it a shot to see if it can work after the reboot.  If the crash happens again, you need to think a little more. Do you have any application recently installed? Do you have any system configuration changed? Uninstall the application or restore the configuration may fix the problem. If the problem persists, you might go to IT services for help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you look into the Window 10 blue screen, it seems it collectes the error information before the restart. It seems a good idea, right? The software engineers need something to refer to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou see, a computer crash annoys you, but it\u0026rsquo;s not a big problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe easiest thing you can do is to restart your computer.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEven you don\u0026rsquo;t understand why it happens, you can try to revert it back, like uninstalling.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe final thing you can do is also easy, that is to find a nice guy to help you!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow coming back to our 90-day life challenge, you can do the same thing as you do for the computer crash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIf your plan doesn\u0026rsquo;t go well, just \u0026ldquo;restart\u0026rdquo; yourself.
