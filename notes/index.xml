&lt;p>Do you think Tara had some difficulties with her relationship with Charles?&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The next week, &lt;a href="https://www.litcharts.com/lit/educated/characters/tara-westover" target="_blank">
Tara
&lt;/a> drives to the nearest Walmart and buys some women’s clothing.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“We arrived at his house. Charles turned on the TV and settled onto the sofa; I perched lightly on one side. The lights dimmed, the opening credits rolled. Charles inched toward me, slowly at first, then more confidently, until his leg brushed mine. In my mind I bolted, I ran a thousand miles in a single heartbeat. In reality I merely flinched. Charles flinched, too—I’d startled him. I repositioned myself, driving my body into the sofa arm, gathering my limbs and pressing them away from him. I held that unnatural pose for perhaps twenty seconds, until he understood, hearing the words I couldn’t say, and moved to the floor.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Tara learned something from her roommate&lt;/li>
&lt;li>She is not satatified with herself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Common sense is not common sense.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sugguestion for girls: Keep smiling and don&amp;rsquo;t say anything.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Though Charles deeply cares for Tara, she’s unable to move their relationship to the next level out of fears, insecurities, and self-hating behaviors instilled in her by years of emotional and verbal abuse at the hands of Gene and Shawn.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Shawn begins calling Tara horrible nicknames like “wench,” “Wilbur,” and “nigger.” None of these nicknames are new, but now that Tara has been to college and learned about the history of slavery, Jim Crow, segregation, and racism in America, she is particularly upset by Shawn’s casual use of the word “nigger.”&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“People at church said Mary could play the piano beautifully. They used the word “professional.” I didn’t know what that meant until one Sunday when Mary played a piano solo for the congregation. The music stopped my breath. I’d heard the piano played countless times before, to accompany hymns, but when Mary played it, the sound was nothing like that formless clunking. It was liquid, it was air. It was rock one moment and wind the next.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next day, when Mary returned from the school, I asked her if instead of money she would give me lessons. We perched on the piano bench and she showed me a few finger exercises. Then she asked what else I was learning besides the piano. Dad had told me what to say when people asked about my schooling. “I do school every day,” I said.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“She’d misunderstood. She thought I didn’t have money. “It isn’t modest,” I said. Her lips parted in surprise. These Californian Moyles, I thought.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Modest:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“The other girls rarely spoke to me, but I loved being there with them. I loved the sensation of conformity. Learning to dance felt like learning to belong. I could memorize the movements and, in doing so, step into their minds, lunging when they lunged, reaching my arms upward in time with theirs. Sometimes, when I glanced at the mirror and saw the tangle of our twirling forms, I couldn’t immediately discern myself in the crowd. It didn’t matter that I was wearing a gray T-shirt—a goose among swans. We moved together, a single flock.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Tara got connected with other people (social people)&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“The music ended. The girls glared at me as we left the stage—I had ruined the performance—but I could barely see them. Only one person in that room felt real to me, and that was Dad. I searched the audience and recognized him easily. He was standing in the back, the lights from the stage flickering off his square glasses. His expression was stiff, impassive, but I could see anger in it.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The dad had a great influence on her.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Because of her father&amp;rsquo;s presence&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“The rest of the night was taken up by my father’s lecture. He said Caroline’s class was one of Satan’s deceptions, like the public school, because it claimed to be one thing when really it was another. It claimed to teach dance, but instead it taught immodesty, promiscuity. Satan was shrewd, Dad said. By calling it “dance,” he had convinced good Mormons to accept the sight of their daughters jumping about like whores in the Lord’s house. That fact offended Dad more than anything else: that such a lewd display had taken place in a church.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Dance suit, should be modest&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Satan was shrewd&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“On the Wednesday after Caroline called Mother, I arrived at Papa Jay’s a few minutes early. The younger class had just finished, and the store was flooded with six-year-olds, prancing for their mothers in red velvet hats and skirts sparkling with sequins of deep scarlet. I watched them wiggle and leap through the aisles, their thin legs covered only by sheer tights. I thought they looked like tiny harlots.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h3 id="singing">Singing&lt;/h3>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“MOTHER MUST HAVE FELT guilty after the recital, because in the weeks that followed she searched for something else I could do, something Dad wouldn’t forbid. She’d noticed the hours I spent in my room with Tyler’s old boom box, listening to the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, so she began looking for a voice teacher. It took a few weeks to find one, and another few weeks to persuade the teacher to take me. The lessons were much more expensive than the dance class had been, but Mother paid for them with the money she made selling oils.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>She loved the girl, and tried her best to help her daughter.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>mindful about&lt;/li>
&lt;li>paying very high attention on her daughter&lt;/li>
&lt;li>balance very well&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Mother played the introduction. The music paused; it was time to sing. I might have had any number of thoughts at that moment. I might have thought of my teacher and her techniques—square stance, straight back, dropped jaw. Instead I thought of Tyler, and of lying on the carpet next to his desk, staring at his woolen-socked feet while the Mormon Tabernacle Choir chanted and trilled. He’d filled my head with their voices, which to me were more beautiful than anything except Buck’s Peak.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Dad smiled at everyone. There was scarcely a person in the church that Dad hadn’t called a gentile—for visiting a doctor or for sending their kids to the public school—but that day he seemed to forget about California socialism and the Illuminati. He stood next to me, a hand on my shoulder, graciously collecting compliments. “We’re very blessed,” he kept saying. “Very blessed.” Papa Jay crossed the chapel and paused in front of our pew. He said I sang like one of God’s own angels. Dad looked at him for a moment, then his eyes began to shine and he shook Papa Jay’s hand like they were old friends.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Very big success&lt;/li>
&lt;li>totally different from the dancing&lt;/li>

&lt;p>“The summer I sang the lead for Annie it was 1999. My father was in serious preparedness mode. Not since I was five, and the Weavers were under siege, had he been so certain that the Days of Abomination were upon us.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dad called it Y2K. On January 1, he said, computer systems all over the world would fail. There would be no electricity, no telephones. All would sink into chaos, and this would usher in the Second Coming of Christ.
”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Can’t they fix it?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Nope, can’t be done,” Dad said. “Man trusted his own strength, and his strength was weak.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>

Worm Creek was full of these people, people whose words seemed ripped from another reality. That was how it felt the first time the director spoke to me, like he was speaking from another dimension. All he said was, “Go find FDR.” I didn’t move.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He tried again. “President Roosevelt. FDR.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Is that like a JCB?” I said. “You need a forklift?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Everyone laughed.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h3 id="a-friend-called-charlies">A friend called Charlies&lt;/h3>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“I’m Charles,” he said. There was a pause while he waited for me to give my name, but I didn’t. “I saw you in the last play,” he said after a moment. “I wanted to tell you something.” I braced myself, for what I wasn’t sure, then he said, “I wanted to tell you that your singing is about the best I ever heard.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Maybe,” I said, and he smiled. A few of his friends stepped into the wing and called to him. He stood and said goodbye, and I watched him join them, taking in the easy way they joked together and imagining an alternate reality in which I was one of them. I imagined Charles inviting me to his house, to play a game or watch a movie, and felt a rush of pleasure. But when I pictured Charles visiting Buck’s Peak, I felt something else, something like panic. What if he found the root cellar? What if he discovered the fuel tank? Then I understood, finally, what the rifle was for. That mighty barrel, with its special range that could reach from the mountain to the valley, was a defensive perimeter for the house, for our supplies, because Dad said we would be driving when everyone else was hotfooting it. We would have food, too, when everyone else was starving, looting. Again I imagined Charles climbing the hill to our house. But in my imagination I was on the ridge, and I was watching his approach through crosshairs.”&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I waited for the screen to flicker and die. I was trying to take it all in, this last, luxurious moment—of sharp yellow light, of warm air flowing from the heater. I was experiencing nostalgia for the life I’d had before, which I would lose at any second, when the world turned and began to devour itself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The longer I sat motionless, breathing deeply, trying to inhale the last scent of the fallen world, the more I resented its continuing solidity. […] Sometime after 1:30 I went to bed. I glimpsed Dad as I left, his face frozen in the dark, the light from the TV leaping across his square glasses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He seemed smaller to me than he had that morning. The disappointment in his features was so childlike, for a moment I wondered how God could deny him this. He, a faithful servant, who suffered willingly just as Noah had willingly suffered to build the ark.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But God withheld the flood.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>“According to Grandma, a hundred years ago a tribe of Apaches had fought the U.S. Cavalry on those faded rocks. The tribe was outnumbered: the battle lost, the war over. All that was left to do was wait to die. Soon after the battle began, the warriors became trapped on a ledge. Unwilling to suffer a humiliating defeat, cut down one by one as they tried to break through the cavalry, they mounted their horses and charged off the face of the mountain. When the Apache women found their broken bodies on the rocks below, they cried huge, desperate tears, which turned to stone when they touched the earth.”&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="q1-how-did-motherfatherme-get-changed-while-mother-became-a-midwife">Q1: How did Mother/father/me get changed while mother became a midwife?&lt;/h2>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Midwifing changed my mother. She was a grown woman with seven children, but this was the first time in her life that she was, without question or caveat, the one in charge. Sometimes, in the days after a birth, I detected in her something of Judy’s heavy presence, in a forceful turn of her head, or the imperious arch of an eyebrow. She stopped wearing makeup, then she stopped apologizing for not wearing it.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>At the beginning, very exhausted&lt;/li>
&lt;li>acted as an assistant&lt;/li>
&lt;li>acted as a midwife herself&lt;/li>
&lt;li>income/money to afford the telephone&lt;/li>
&lt;li>not so boring, help people&lt;/li>
&lt;li>cheaper but illegal&lt;/li>
&lt;li>only in charge&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Offered such a job under such circumstances, accept or not?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>age: 30 or 40 year-old?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>7 children, baby&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Her father really force her mother to work&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As long as we have income, then nobody can force us&lt;/li>
&lt;li>hesitated to make a change&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Every child is different&lt;/li>
&lt;li>stable&lt;/li>
&lt;li>She worked a housewife&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Why did she married such a kind of guy?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>妇产科 （Obstetrics and Gynecology） vs . Midwife&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Harvard Positive Psychology&lt;/li>
&lt;li>survivalist&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Dad stood there for several seconds, his mouth open. Of course a midwife needs a phone, he said. Then he went back to the junkyard and that’s all that was ever said about it. We hadn’t had a telephone for as long as I could remember, but the next day there it was, resting in a lime-green cradle, its glossy finish looking out of place next to the murky jars of cohosh and skullcap.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>She barked orders and we moved wordlessly to follow them. The baby was born without complications. It was mythic and romantic, being an intimate witness to this turn in life’s cycle, but Mother had been right, I didn’t like it. It was long and exhausting, and smelled of groin sweat.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="q2-how-can-we-learn-from-the-midwife-story-to-make-a-change-in-our-life">Q2: How can we learn from the midwife story to make a change in our life?&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Money is the most important thing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you earn above an amount, doesn&amp;rsquo;t make a different. (Survey)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How to spend the money? For eating or helping others&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The next time the midwife came she brought her daughter Maria, who stood next to her mother, imitating her movements, with a baby wedged against her wiry nine-year-old frame. I stared hopefully at her. I hadn’t met many other girls like me, who didn’t go to school. I edged closer, trying to draw her attention, but she was wholly absorbed in listening to her mother, who was explaining how cramp bark and motherwort should be administered to treat post-birth contractions. Maria’s head bobbed in agreement; her eyes never left her mother’s face.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>THERE WERE NO HERBALISTS in Wyoming as good as Mother, so a few months after the incident at the hospital, Judy came to Buck’s Peak to restock. The two women chatted in the kitchen, Judy perched on a barstool, Mother leaning across the counter, her head resting lazily in her hand. I took the list of herbs to the storeroom. Maria, lugging a different baby, followed. I pulled dried leaves and clouded liquids from the shelves, all the while gushing about Mother’s exploits, finishing with the confrontation in the hospital. Maria had her own stories about dodging Feds, but when she began to tell one I interrupted her.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Judy is a fine midwife,” I said, my chest rising. “But when it comes to doctors and cops, nobody plays stupid like my mother.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;p>Part of me hopes you’ll have a child, because I’m a great believer in time’s revenge, yea unto the next generation and the next.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Right: fucking bastards. Except to Adrian, who listened to our denunciations, but rarely joined in. And yet, it seemed to us, he had more cause than most. His mother had walked out years before, leaving his dad to cope with Adrian and his sister. This was long before the term ‘single-parent family’ came into use; back then it was ‘a broken home’, and Adrian was the only person we knew who came from one. This ought to have given him a whole storetank of existential rage, but somehow it didn’t; he said he loved his mother and respected his father. Privately, the three of us examined his case and came up with a theory: that the key to a happy family life was for there not to be a family – or at least, not one living together. Having made this analysis, we envied Adrian the more.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Memory differs from the old facts/reality
cowardice / peaceable

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Or perhaps it’s that same paradox again: the history that happens underneath our noses ought to be the clearest, and yet it’s the most deliquescent. We live in time, it bounds us and defines us, and time is supposed to measure history, isn’t it? But if we can’t understand time, can’t grasp its mysteries of pace and progress, what chance do we have with history – even our own small, personal, largely undocumented piece of it?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>And it ought to be obvious to us that time doesn’t act as a fixative, rather as a solvent. But it’s not convenient – it’s not useful – to believe this; it doesn’t help us get on with our lives; so we ignore it.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>The father making jokes on Tony, a lot of negative words to describe, for example “lower-class scum”, shows that Tony didn’t like father;&lt;/li>

&lt;li>The mother looks very different;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>One evidence by the author “This is my principal factual memory…” that the memory might be very different with the fact. So the reader should be very skeptical to what we read in this part.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Looks like Veronica is not treating Tony not very well. Veronica didn’t kiss Tony good evening. Join their examination. This might because Tony hate Veronica because Veronica went out with Adrian.&lt;/li>

this practice session

&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://english-reading-club.github.io/windows-10-bluescreen.png" alt="Windows 10 blue screen">&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Your PC run into a problem and need to restart. We&amp;rsquo;re just collecting some error info, and then you can restart.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://english-reading-club.github.io/macos-crash-1.png" alt="macOS crash screen">
&lt;img src="https://english-reading-club.github.io/macos-crash-2.png" alt="macOS crash screen">&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Your computer restarted because of a problem. Press a key or wait a few seconds to continue starting up.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Yesterday, in a WeChat group, we had such a great fun blaming and teasing the IT services in our company. Our IT installed various software to secure our computers, but it ended up making them crappy. Computers sometimes become unresponsive, sometimes even crashed. Crashed like a dog!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But I have to say, it is NOT our IT services to be blamed. The computer is such a complicated system, no matter it is a Windows laptop, a MacBook, or a Linux box, that the crash happened because of various root causes. Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s a bug of the underlying operating system, perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s a compatibility problem that is brought by the applications you or the IT services just installed, 0r perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s just because your computer is in a bad mood! God knows!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But even if the computer crashes from time to time, you cannot give it up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You need to face it! You just give it a shot to see if it can work after the reboot. If the crash happens again, you need to think a little more. Do you have any application recently installed? Do you have any system configuration changed? Uninstall the application or restore the configuration may fix the problem. If the problem persists, you might go to IT services for help.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you look into the Window 10 blue screen, it seems it collectes the error information before the restart. It seems a good idea, right? The software engineers need something to refer to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You see, a computer crash annoys you, but it&amp;rsquo;s not a big problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The easiest thing you can do is to restart your computer.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Even you don&amp;rsquo;t understand why it happens, you can try to revert it back, like uninstalling.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The final thing you can do is also easy, that is to find a nice guy to help you!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Now coming back to our 90-day life challenge, you can do the same thing as you do for the computer crash.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If your plan doesn&amp;rsquo;t go well, just &amp;ldquo;restart&amp;rdquo; yourself. Take a nap, take a shower, have a good meal. Anything enjoyable can bring you energy&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Even if you don&amp;rsquo;t understand why it happens, you can refer to your diary or your journal to, kind of, revert your life back.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The final thing you can do is also easy, that is to find somebody you really trust to help you out, your 90-day life buddy, your families, your close friends.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>You see, if your plan doesn&amp;rsquo;t go well, it&amp;rsquo;s not a big problem &amp;ndash; JUST give it another shot!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Book 17 Chapter 13</title><link>https://english-reading-club.github.io/notes/book-16-chapter-13/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Jan 2021 12:19:43 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://english-reading-club.github.io/notes/book-16-chapter-13/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="90-day-success-principles">90-day success principles&lt;/h2>
