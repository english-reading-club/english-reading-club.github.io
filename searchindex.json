He fled to his jeep and I didn’t hear from him for several hours, then he called and asked me to meet him at the church. He wouldn’t come to Buck’s Peak. We sat in his jeep in the dark, empty parking lot. He was crying.\n What was important to me wasn’t love or friendship, but my ability to lie convincingly to myself: to believe I was strong. I could never forgive Charles for knowing I wasn’t.\n He said he loved me but this was over his head. He couldn’t save me. Only I could.\n “Sorry, Siddle Lister, but it hurts less if you don’t see it coming.”\n Only an X-ray could prove otherwise. Thus, the X-ray would break my toe.\n I was filled with an exquisite numbness. I felt drunk with it and wanted to shout at the world: Here’s the proof: nothing touches me.\n ichard was the miracle son, the gift from God, the Einstein to disprove Einstein. Richard would move the world. Shawn would not.\n “You drive,”\n Shawn can smell shame.\n “Don’t want your boyfriend to see you looking so glamorous?” He smiles and jabs me with his finger. He is looking at me strangely, as if to say, This is who you are. You’ve been pretending that you’re someone else. Someone better. But you are just this.\n I go with him into the bright lights. I laugh as we pass through aisle after aisle, gathering the things he wants to buy. I laugh at every word he says, trying to convince anyone who might have been in the parking lot that it was all a joke. I’m walking on a sprained ankle, but the pain barely registers.\n Dad sees nothing.\n I ask myself questions. Why didn’t he stop when I begged him? It was like getting beaten by a zombie, I write. Like he couldn’t hear me.\n Was it really fun and games? I write. Could he not tell he was hurting me? I don’t know. I just don’t know.\n It’s comforting to think the defect is mine, because that means it is under my power.\n There was one point when he was forcing me from the car, that he had both hands pinned above my head and my shirt rose up. I asked him to let me fix it but it was like he couldn’t hear me. He just stared at it like a great big jerk. It’s a good thing I’m as small as I am. If I was larger, at that moment, I would have torn him apart.\n my humiliation was the cause of that pleasure\n I retrieved my journal and I wrote another entry, opposite the first, in which I revised the memory. It was a misunderstanding, I wrote. If I’d asked him to stop, he would have.\n Not knowing for certain, but refusing to give way to those who claim certainty, was a privilege I had never allowed myself. My life was narrated for me by others. Their voices were forceful, emphatic, absolute. It had never occurred to me that my voice might be as strong as theirs.\n I could not be near any man without despising myself.\n one that was less about actions and more about essence. It was not that I had done something wrong so much as that I existed in the wrong way. There was something impure in the fact of my being.\n It’s strange how you give the people you love so much power over you, I had written in my journal. But Shawn had more power over me than I could possibly have imagined. He had defined me to myself, and there’s no greater power than that.\n Shawn played the same games with her he’d played with Sadie, testing his control. She never failed to follow his orders, quivering when he raised his voice, apologizing when he screamed at her. That their marriage would be manipulative and violent\n I have so many bills I can’t imagine how I’m going to pay them. But God will provide either trials for growth or the means to succeed.\n The check was in my hand. I was so tempted, the pain in my jaw so savage, that I must have held it for ten seconds before passing it back.\n When I called Shawn and asked who he’d sold Bud to, he mumbled something vague about a guy passing through from Tooele.\n He pulled out his wallet, opened it and extracted a crisp hundred-dollar bill.\n I BELIEVED THAT HUNDRED dollars was a sign from God.\n She knew I was lying—I could tell because when Dad came in unexpectedly and asked why she was copying the returns, she said the duplicates were for her records.\n He never asked why I’d been sneaking into my own house at three in the morning, and I never asked who he’d been waiting for, sitting up in the middle of the night, with a loaded pistol.\n “Look, honey,” she said. “You get that much because that’s how much you get. Cash it or don’t, it’s up to you.”\n I’d believed the money would be used to control me, but what it did was enable me to keep my word to myself: for the first time, when I said I would never again work for my father, I believed it.\n I never uttered the words “I’m from Idaho” until I’d left it.\n I began to experience the most powerful advantage of money: the ability to think of things besides money.\n My textbooks began to make sense, and I found myself doing more than the required reading.\n bipolar disorder\n This is my father, I wrote in my notes. He’s describing Dad.\n Ruby Ridge\n Ruby Ridge, Idaho\n Randy Weaver and a number of Federal agencies, including the U.S. Marshals Service and the FBI.\n the shooting of a boy, then of his father, then of his mother. The Government had murdered the entire family, parents and children, to cover up what they had done.\n Randy Weaver was arrested\n blasting the government’s callous disregard for life\n Randy Weaver had been interviewed by major news organizations and had even co-written a book with his daughter. He now made his living speaking at gun shows.\n Why had federal agents surrounded Randy Weaver’s cabin in the first place?\n Why had Randy been targeted?\n the conflict had begun when Randy sold two sawed-off shotguns to an undercover agent he’d met at an Aryan Nations gathering.\n white supremacy was at the heart of this story, not homeschool.\n Dad must have read about Ruby Ridge or seen it on the news, and somehow as it passed through his feverish brain, it had ceased to be a story about someone else and had become a story about him.\n irst, because they are genetically predisposed to mood disorders\n second, because of the stressful environment and poor parenting of parents with such disorders\n he kept on believing himself right—after the first car crash, after the second, after the bin, the fire, the pallet. And it was us who paid.\n not about the car, but about the Weavers.\n Why are you like this?\n Why did you terrify us like that?\n Why did you fight so hard against made-up monsters, but do nothing about the monsters in your own house?\n If I could just pretend to be normal for a little while, maybe it would feel like the truth.\n Given the choice between seeing an evil socialist doctor, and admitting to my boyfriend that I believed doctors were evil socialists, I chose to see the doctor.\n You’re positive for strep and mono. Only person I’ve seen in a month to get both.\n There I was, in the heart of the Medical Establishment, and I wanted to see, at long last, what it was I had always been afraid of. Would my eyes bleed? My tongue fall out? Surely something awful would happen. I needed to know what.\n She hadn’t sent any remedies for the strep or the mono.

They used the word “professional.” I didn’t know what that meant until one Sunday when Mary played a piano solo for the congregation. The music stopped my breath. I’d heard the piano played countless times before, to accompany hymns, but when Mary played it, the sound was nothing like that formless clunking. It was liquid, it was air. It was rock one moment and wind the next.\nThe next day, when Mary returned from the school, I asked her if instead of money she would give me lessons. We perched on the piano bench and she showed me a few finger exercises. Then she asked what else I was learning besides the piano. Dad had told me what to say when people asked about my schooling. “I do school every day,” I said.”\n Tara is talented in music, and like music a lot.\nVery curious\nGive up a bit of money\nDancing  “She’d misunderstood. She thought I didn’t have money. “It isn’t modest,” I said. Her lips parted in surprise. These Californian Moyles, I thought.”\n Modest:\n “The other girls rarely spoke to me, but I loved being there with them. I loved the sensation of conformity. Learning to dance felt like learning to belong. I could memorize the movements and, in doing so, step into their minds, lunging when they lunged, reaching my arms upward in time with theirs. Sometimes, when I glanced at the mirror and saw the tangle of our twirling forms, I couldn’t immediately discern myself in the crowd. It didn’t matter that I was wearing a gray T-shirt—a goose among swans. We moved together, a single flock.”\n  Tara got connected with other people (social people) Not isolated, being in a group of people a goose among swans belonging 自卑 not confident   “The music ended. The girls glared at me as we left the stage—I had ruined the performance—but I could barely see them. Only one person in that room felt real to me, and that was Dad. I searched the audience and recognized him easily. He was standing in the back, the lights from the stage flickering off his square glasses. His expression was stiff, impassive, but I could see anger in it.”\n   The dad had a great influence on her.\n  Because of her father\u0026rsquo;s presence\n  Maybe a disater\n  Honorable girl, still managed\n  Parent are not aware of their mistakes. (saving her daughter)\n   “The rest of the night was taken up by my father’s lecture. He said Caroline’s class was one of Satan’s deceptions, like the public school, because it claimed to be one thing when really it was another. It claimed to teach dance, but instead it taught immodesty, promiscuity. Satan was shrewd, Dad said. By calling it “dance,” he had convinced good Mormons to accept the sight of their daughters jumping about like whores in the Lord’s house. That fact offended Dad more than anything else: that such a lewd display had taken place in a church.”\n  Dance suit, should be modest Satan was shrewd    “On the Wednesday after Caroline called Mother, I arrived at Papa Jay’s a few minutes early. The younger class had just finished, and the store was flooded with six-year-olds, prancing for their mothers in red velvet hats and skirts sparkling with sequins of deep scarlet. I watched them wiggle and leap through the aisles, their thin legs covered only by sheer tights. I thought they looked like tiny harlots.”\n Singing  “MOTHER MUST HAVE FELT guilty after the recital, because in the weeks that followed she searched for something else I could do, something Dad wouldn’t forbid. She’d noticed the hours I spent in my room with Tyler’s old boom box, listening to the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, so she began looking for a voice teacher. It took a few weeks to find one, and another few weeks to persuade the teacher to take me. The lessons were much more expensive than the dance class had been, but Mother paid for them with the money she made selling oils.”\n  She loved the girl, and tried her best to help her daughter. mindful about paying very high attention on her daughter balance very well   “Mother played the introduction. The music paused; it was time to sing. I might have had any number of thoughts at that moment. I might have thought of my teacher and her techniques—square stance, straight back, dropped jaw. Instead I thought of Tyler, and of lying on the carpet next to his desk, staring at his woolen-socked feet while the Mormon Tabernacle Choir chanted and trilled. He’d filled my head with their voices, which to me were more beautiful than anything except Buck’s Peak.”\n  “Dad smiled at everyone. There was scarcely a person in the church that Dad hadn’t called a gentile—for visiting a doctor or for sending their kids to the public school—but that day he seemed to forget about California socialism and the Illuminati. He stood next to me, a hand on my shoulder, graciously collecting compliments. “We’re very blessed,” he kept saying. “Very blessed.” Papa Jay crossed the chapel and paused in front of our pew. He said I sang like one of God’s own angels. Dad looked at him for a moment, then his eyes began to shine and he shook Papa Jay’s hand like they were old friends.”\n  Very big success totally different from the dancing church event   “I’ll find the money,” he told Mother when they went to bed that night. “You get her to that audition.”\n Chapter 9: Perfect in His Generation LitCharts - Summary and Analysis \nDad called it Y2K.  “The summer I sang the lead for Annie it was 1999. My father was in serious preparedness mode. Not since I was five, and the Weavers were under siege, had he been so certain that the Days of Abomination were upon us.\nDad called it Y2K. On January 1, he said, computer systems all over the world would fail. There would be no electricity, no telephones. All would sink into chaos, and this would usher in the Second Coming of Christ. ”\n  “Can’t they fix it?”\n“Nope, can’t be done,” Dad said. “Man trusted his own strength, and his strength was weak.”\n At the Worm Creek Opera House  “I’d never learned how to talk to people who weren’t like us—people who went to school and visited the doctor. Who weren’t preparing, every day, for the End of the World. Worm Creek was full of these people, people whose words seemed ripped from another reality. That was how it felt the first time the director spoke to me, like he was speaking from another dimension. All he said was, “Go find FDR.” I didn’t move.\nHe tried again. “President Roosevelt. FDR.”\n“Is that like a JCB?” I said. “You need a forklift?”\nEveryone laughed.”\n A friend called Charlies  “I’m Charles,” he said. There was a pause while he waited for me to give my name, but I didn’t. “I saw you in the last play,” he said after a moment. “I wanted to tell you something.” I braced myself, for what I wasn’t sure, then he said, “I wanted to tell you that your singing is about the best I ever heard.”\n  “Maybe,” I said, and he smiled. A few of his friends stepped into the wing and called to him. He stood and said goodbye, and I watched him join them, taking in the easy way they joked together and imagining an alternate reality in which I was one of them. I imagined Charles inviting me to his house, to play a game or watch a movie, and felt a rush of pleasure. But when I pictured Charles visiting Buck’s Peak, I felt something else, something like panic. What if he found the root cellar? What if he discovered the fuel tank? Then I understood, finally, what the rifle was for. That mighty barrel, with its special range that could reach from the mountain to the valley, was a defensive perimeter for the house, for our supplies, because Dad said we would be driving when everyone else was hotfooting it. We would have food, too, when everyone else was starving, looting. Again I imagined Charles climbing the hill to our house. But in my imagination I was on the ridge, and I was watching his approach through crosshairs.”\n   Y2K problem didn\u0026rsquo;t happen  I waited for the screen to flicker and die. I was trying to take it all in, this last, luxurious moment—of sharp yellow light, of warm air flowing from the heater. I was experiencing nostalgia for the life I’d had before, which I would lose at any second, when the world turned and began to devour itself.\nThe longer I sat motionless, breathing deeply, trying to inhale the last scent of the fallen world, the more I resented its continuing solidity. […] Sometime after 1:30 I went to bed. I glimpsed Dad as I left, his face frozen in the dark, the light from the TV leaping across his square glasses.\nHe seemed smaller to me than he had that morning. The disappointment in his features was so childlike, for a moment I wondered how God could deny him this. He, a faithful servant, who suffered willingly just as Noah had willingly suffered to build the ark.\nBut God withheld the flood.\n Themes Devoutness and Delusion  Family, Abuse, and Entrapment  Memory, History, and Subjectivity  Next session  Homework: Finish Ch9, Ch10 Host Volunteer: Samantha  Questions Excerpts    ","date":"26 May, 2021","id":9,"permalink":"/notes/book-18-sessions-5/","summary":"Notes Chapter 7: The Lord Will Provide His father is calm\nTreatment is very simple.\nChapter 8: Tiny Harlots Litcharts - Chapter Summary \u0026amp; Analysis \n har·lot | ˈhärlət | noun archaic a prostitute.\n• dated, derogatory a woman who has many casual sexual encounters or relationships.\n Playing Piano  “People at church said Mary could play the piano beautifully.

We hadn’t had a telephone for as long as I could remember, but the next day there it was, resting in a lime-green cradle, its glossy finish looking out of place next to the murky jars of cohosh and skullcap.\n  She barked orders and we moved wordlessly to follow them. The baby was born without complications. It was mythic and romantic, being an intimate witness to this turn in life’s cycle, but Mother had been right, I didn’t like it. It was long and exhausting, and smelled of groin sweat.\n Q2: How can we learn from the midwife story to make a change in our life?  Money is the most important thing. If you earn above an amount, doesn\u0026rsquo;t make a different. (Survey) How to spend the money? For eating or helping others   The next time the midwife came she brought her daughter Maria, who stood next to her mother, imitating her movements, with a baby wedged against her wiry nine-year-old frame. I stared hopefully at her. I hadn’t met many other girls like me, who didn’t go to school. I edged closer, trying to draw her attention, but she was wholly absorbed in listening to her mother, who was explaining how cramp bark and motherwort should be administered to treat post-birth contractions. Maria’s head bobbed in agreement; her eyes never left her mother’s face.\n  THERE WERE NO HERBALISTS in Wyoming as good as Mother, so a few months after the incident at the hospital, Judy came to Buck’s Peak to restock. The two women chatted in the kitchen, Judy perched on a barstool, Mother leaning across the counter, her head resting lazily in her hand. I took the list of herbs to the storeroom. Maria, lugging a different baby, followed. I pulled dried leaves and clouded liquids from the shelves, all the while gushing about Mother’s exploits, finishing with the confrontation in the hospital. Maria had her own stories about dodging Feds, but when she began to tell one I interrupted her.\n“Judy is a fine midwife,” I said, my chest rising. “But when it comes to doctors and cops, nobody plays stupid like my mother.”\n Next session  Homework: ?

Reading may delight us or move us; we may read for instruction or inspiration. But more than this, in reading we discover ourselves. We gain access to the lives of others, explore the limitless possibilities of human existence, develop our understanding of the world around us, and find respite from the hectic demands of everyday life. In You Are What You Read, DiYanni provides a practical guide that shows how we can increase the benefits and pleasures of reading literature by becoming more skillful and engaged readers.\nDiYanni suggests that we attend first to what authors say and the way in which they say it, rather than rushing to decide what they mean. He considers the various forms of literature, from the essay to the novel, the short story to the poem, demonstrating rewarding approaches to each in sample readings of classic works. Through a series of illuminating oppositions, he explores the paradoxical pleasures of reading: solitary versus social reading, submitting to or resisting the author, reading inwardly or outwardly, and more. DiYanni closes with nine recommended reading practices, thoughts on the different experiences of print and digital reading, and advice on what to read and why.\nSource: Amazon \n  “Robert DiYanni’s You Are What You Read is an ardent, well-conceived guide to how readers can improve their experience of a diverse range of literary texts. At a time when skepticism about the humanities abounds, DiYanni offers a valuable window into the ways our inner lives flourish and expand under the influence of poetry, fiction, and nonfiction prose.”—David Haven Blake, author of Walt Whitman and the Culture of American Celebrity\nSource: Princeton Press \n [Non-fiction 3, 370 pages] How to Talk So Kids Will Listen \u0026amp; Listen So Kids Will Talk, by Adele Faber and Elaine Mazlish  “This parenting book actually made me a better parent.”—Lydia Kiesling, The New York Times\nFrom #1 New York Times bestselling authors, the ultimate “parenting bible” (The Boston Globe)—a timeless, beloved book on how to effectively communicate with your child.\nThis bestselling classic by internationally acclaimed experts on communication between parents and children includes fresh insights and suggestions, as well as the author’s time-tested methods to solve common problems and build foundations for lasting relationships, including innovative ways to:\nSource: Amazon \n [Non-fiction 4, 273 pages] Crucial Conversations: Tools for Talking When Stakes are High, by Kerry Patterson, Al Switzler, Joseph Grenny, Ron McMillan  The New York Times and Washington Post bestseller that changed the way millions communicate\n“[Crucial Conversations] draws our attention to those defining moments that literally shape our lives, our relationships, and our world. . . .

It was chosen as one of the best 100 books of 2012 by the San Francisco Chronicle,[1] was a New York Times Editor\u0026rsquo;s Choice,[2] and was on the New York Times Hardcover Fiction Best Seller list[3] as well as the NPR Hardcover Fiction Bestseller List.[4] The US book cover, which glows in the dark, was done by Rodrigo Corral and chosen as one of the 25 best book covers for 2012 by BookPage.[5][6][7]\nMr. Penumbra\u0026rsquo;s 24-Hour Bookstore combines elements of fantasy, mystery, friendship and adventure as a way of looking at the modern conflict and transition between new technology (electronic) and old (print books). The protagonist (主角) is a laid-off Silicon Valley tech worker who begins working at a dusty bookstore with very few customers, only to start discovering one secret after another. The mysterious old books, along with the store\u0026rsquo;s owner, lead to a 500-year-old secret society.[8]\nSource: Wikipedia \n  The Great Recession has shuffled Clay Jannon out of his life as a San Francisco Web-design drone—and serendipity(机缘巧合), sheer curiosity, and the ability to climb a ladder like a monkey has landed him a new gig（工作） working the night shift at Mr. Penumbra\u0026rsquo;s 24-Hour Bookstore. But after just a few days on the job, Clay begins to realize that this store is even more curious than the name suggests. There are only a few customers, but they come in repeatedly and never seem to actually buy anything, instead \u0026ldquo;checking out\u0026rdquo; impossibly obscure volumes from strange corners of the store, all according to some elaborate, long-standing arrangement with the gnomic（深奥的） Mr. Penumbra. The store must be a front for something larger, Clay concludes, and soon he\u0026rsquo;s embarked on a complex analysis of the customers' behavior and roped his friends into helping to figure out just what\u0026rsquo;s going on.

Concerned about Valentina’s motives, Nadezhda and Vera are drawn back into contact with each other after a long period of estrangement (疏远). They find themselves united against a common enemy in Valentina, whose grasping, manipulative behavior escalates until the daughters finally succeed in obtaining a divorce for their father.\nThe Polish translator and travel writer Magda Healey, reviewing the book for Bookbag, thought it \u0026ldquo;eminently(非常) readable, well flowing and colourful\u0026rdquo;, though it showed a common fault of autobiographical debut novels, with too much content crammed in, the stories often not thoroughly explored. All the same, it had moving moments, some poetically beautiful passages, and \u0026ldquo;wonderfully absurd\u0026rdquo; scenes of farce. She found the sections of the engineer Nikolai\u0026rsquo;s monumental history of tractors \u0026ldquo;a nice device\u0026rdquo;. It was undemanding \u0026ldquo;but not totally shallow\u0026rdquo;.[4]\nSource: Wikipedia \n  Award-winning writer Tanika Gupta has created a wonderful re-telling of this dark family comedy, adapted from the bestselling novel by Marina Lewycka for the stage. It explores the hopes and hardships of immigrants, and how past experiences can shape families and relationships.\nSource: Amazon \n References SharePoint  SAP SharePoint (book preview)  持续更新的下一本书意向清单，欢迎随时添加: SAP Excel Online   MS Forms  MS Forms in our Group    This is because they were part of either Pioneer or Insider ring.

Except to Adrian, who listened to our denunciations, but rarely joined in. And yet, it seemed to us, he had more cause than most. His mother had walked out years before, leaving his dad to cope with Adrian and his sister. This was long before the term ‘single-parent family’ came into use; back then it was ‘a broken home’, and Adrian was the only person we knew who came from one. This ought to have given him a whole storetank of existential rage, but somehow it didn’t; he said he loved his mother and respected his father. Privately, the three of us examined his case and came up with a theory: that the key to a happy family life was for there not to be a family – or at least, not one living together.

Think about how we deal with a crashed computer, and think about what to do if our plan doesn\u0026rsquo;t go well  Restart Yourself Bring Yourself back Ask for help    Teams  Shuuka \u0026amp; Mia Mike \u0026amp; Hongyan Jizu \u0026amp; Giselle  Just Crashed ? Give it a 3-step Fix! Author: Jizu SUN \nThis is a prepared speech in this practice session \n Your PC run into a problem and need to restart. We\u0026rsquo;re just collecting some error info, and then you can restart.\n  Your computer restarted because of a problem. Press a key or wait a few seconds to continue starting up.\n Yesterday, in a WeChat group, we had such a great fun blaming and teasing the IT services in our company. Our IT installed various software to secure our computers, but it ended up making them crappy. Computers sometimes become unresponsive, sometimes even crashed. Crashed like a dog!\nBut I have to say, it is NOT our IT services to be blamed. The computer is such a complicated system, no matter it is a Windows laptop, a MacBook, or a Linux box, that the crash happened because of various root causes. Perhaps it\u0026rsquo;s a bug of the underlying operating system, perhaps it\u0026rsquo;s a compatibility problem that is brought by the applications you or the IT services just installed, 0r perhaps it\u0026rsquo;s just because your computer is in a bad mood! God knows!\nBut even if the computer crashes from time to time, you cannot give it up.\nYou need to face it! You just give it a shot to see if it can work after the reboot. If the crash happens again, you need to think a little more. Do you have any application recently installed? Do you have any system configuration changed? Uninstall the application or restore the configuration may fix the problem. If the problem persists, you might go to IT services for help.\nIf you look into the Window 10 blue screen, it seems it collectes the error information before the restart. It seems a good idea, right? The software engineers need something to refer to.\nYou see, a computer crash annoys you, but it\u0026rsquo;s not a big problem.\n The easiest thing you can do is to restart your computer. Even you don\u0026rsquo;t understand why it happens, you can try to revert it back, like uninstalling. The final thing you can do is also easy, that is to find a nice guy to help you!  Now coming back to our 90-day life challenge, you can do the same thing as you do for the computer crash.\n If your plan doesn\u0026rsquo;t go well, just \u0026ldquo;restart\u0026rdquo; yourself. Take a nap, take a shower, have a good meal. Anything enjoyable can bring you energy Even if you don\u0026rsquo;t understand why it happens, you can refer to your diary or your journal to, kind of, revert your life back. The final thing you can do is also easy, that is to find somebody you really trust to help you out, your 90-day life buddy, your families, your close friends.  You see, if your plan doesn\u0026rsquo;t go well, it\u0026rsquo;s not a big problem \u0026ndash; JUST give it another shot!\n","date":"3 February, 2021","id":26,"permalink":"/notes/book-16-practice-session-1/","summary":"Files Xmind files on SharePoint \nTake turns to represent yourself 1.
