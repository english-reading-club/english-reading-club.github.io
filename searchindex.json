We\u0026rsquo;re just collecting some error info, and then you can restart.\n  Your computer restarted because of a problem. Press a key or wait a few seconds to continue starting up.\n Yesterday, in a WeChat group, we had such a great fun blaming and teasing the IT services in our company. Our IT installed various software to secure our computers, but it ended up making them crappy. Computers sometimes become unresponsive, sometimes even crashed. Crashed like a dog!\nBut I have to say, it is NOT our IT services to be blamed. The computer is such a complicated system, no matter it is a Windows laptop, a MacBook, or a Linux box, that the crash happened because of various root causes. Perhaps it\u0026rsquo;s a bug of the underlying operating system, perhaps it\u0026rsquo;s a compatibility problem that is brought by the applications you or the IT services just installed, 0r perhaps it\u0026rsquo;s just because your computer is in a bad mood! God knows!\nBut even if the computer crashes from time to time, you cannot give it up.\nYou need to face it! You just give it a shot to see if it can work after the reboot. If the crash happens again, you need to think a little more. Do you have any application recently installed? Do you have any system configuration changed? Uninstall the application or restore the configuration may fix the problem. If the problem persists, you might go to IT services for help.\nIf you look into the Window 10 blue screen, it seems it collectes the error information before the restart. It seems a good idea, right? The software engineers need something to refer to.\nYou see, a computer crash annoys you, but it\u0026rsquo;s not a big problem.\n The easiest thing you can do is to restart your computer. Even you don\u0026rsquo;t understand why it happens, you can try to revert it back, like uninstalling. The final thing you can do is also easy, that is to find a nice guy to help you!  Now coming back to our 90-day life challenge, you can do the same thing as you do for the computer crash.\n If your plan doesn\u0026rsquo;t go well, just \u0026ldquo;restart\u0026rdquo; yourself. Take a nap, take a shower, have a good meal. Anything enjoyable can bring you energy Even if you don\u0026rsquo;t understand why it happens, you can refer to your diary or your journal to, kind of, revert your life back. The final thing you can do is also easy, that is to find somebody you really trust to help you out, your 90-day life buddy, your families, your close friends.  You see, if your plan doesn\u0026rsquo;t go well, it\u0026rsquo;s not a big problem \u0026ndash; JUST give it another shot!\nAuthor: Jizu SUN\n","date":"3 February, 2021","id":1,"permalink":"/notes/just-crashed-give-it-3-step-fix/","summary":"Summary This is a prepared speech in this practice session\n Your PC run into a problem and need to restart.
