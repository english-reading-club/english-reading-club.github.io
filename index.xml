&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“People at church said Mary could play the piano beautifully. They used the word “professional.” I didn’t know what that meant until one Sunday when Mary played a piano solo for the congregation. The music stopped my breath. I’d heard the piano played countless times before, to accompany hymns, but when Mary played it, the sound was nothing like that formless clunking. It was liquid, it was air. It was rock one moment and wind the next.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next day, when Mary returned from the school, I asked her if instead of money she would give me lessons. We perched on the piano bench and she showed me a few finger exercises. Then she asked what else I was learning besides the piano. Dad had told me what to say when people asked about my schooling. “I do school every day,” I said.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“She’d misunderstood. She thought I didn’t have money. “It isn’t modest,” I said. Her lips parted in surprise. These Californian Moyles, I thought.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Modest:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“The other girls rarely spoke to me, but I loved being there with them. I loved the sensation of conformity. Learning to dance felt like learning to belong. I could memorize the movements and, in doing so, step into their minds, lunging when they lunged, reaching my arms upward in time with theirs. Sometimes, when I glanced at the mirror and saw the tangle of our twirling forms, I couldn’t immediately discern myself in the crowd. It didn’t matter that I was wearing a gray T-shirt—a goose among swans. We moved together, a single flock.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Tara got connected with other people (social people)&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“The music ended. The girls glared at me as we left the stage—I had ruined the performance—but I could barely see them. Only one person in that room felt real to me, and that was Dad. I searched the audience and recognized him easily. He was standing in the back, the lights from the stage flickering off his square glasses. His expression was stiff, impassive, but I could see anger in it.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The dad had a great influence on her.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Because of her father&amp;rsquo;s presence&lt;/p>

&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“The rest of the night was taken up by my father’s lecture. He said Caroline’s class was one of Satan’s deceptions, like the public school, because it claimed to be one thing when really it was another. It claimed to teach dance, but instead it taught immodesty, promiscuity. Satan was shrewd, Dad said. By calling it “dance,” he had convinced good Mormons to accept the sight of their daughters jumping about like whores in the Lord’s house. That fact offended Dad more than anything else: that such a lewd display had taken place in a church.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Dance suit, should be modest&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Satan was shrewd&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“On the Wednesday after Caroline called Mother, I arrived at Papa Jay’s a few minutes early. The younger class had just finished, and the store was flooded with six-year-olds, prancing for their mothers in red velvet hats and skirts sparkling with sequins of deep scarlet. I watched them wiggle and leap through the aisles, their thin legs covered only by sheer tights. I thought they looked like tiny harlots.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h3 id="singing">Singing&lt;/h3>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“MOTHER MUST HAVE FELT guilty after the recital, because in the weeks that followed she searched for something else I could do, something Dad wouldn’t forbid. She’d noticed the hours I spent in my room with Tyler’s old boom box, listening to the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, so she began looking for a voice teacher. It took a few weeks to find one, and another few weeks to persuade the teacher to take me. The lessons were much more expensive than the dance class had been, but Mother paid for them with the money she made selling oils.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>She loved the girl, and tried her best to help her daughter.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>mindful about&lt;/li>
&lt;li>paying very high attention on her daughter&lt;/li>
&lt;li>balance very well&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Mother played the introduction. The music paused; it was time to sing. I might have had any number of thoughts at that moment. I might have thought of my teacher and her techniques—square stance, straight back, dropped jaw. Instead I thought of Tyler, and of lying on the carpet next to his desk, staring at his woolen-socked feet while the Mormon Tabernacle Choir chanted and trilled. He’d filled my head with their voices, which to me were more beautiful than anything except Buck’s Peak.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Dad smiled at everyone. There was scarcely a person in the church that Dad hadn’t called a gentile—for visiting a doctor or for sending their kids to the public school—but that day he seemed to forget about California socialism and the Illuminati. He stood next to me, a hand on my shoulder, graciously collecting compliments. “We’re very blessed,” he kept saying. “Very blessed.” Papa Jay crossed the chapel and paused in front of our pew. He said I sang like one of God’s own angels. Dad looked at him for a moment, then his eyes began to shine and he shook Papa Jay’s hand like they were old friends.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Very big success&lt;/li>
&lt;li>totally different from the dancing&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>“I’ll find the money,” he told Mother when they went to bed that night. “You get her to that audition.”&lt;/p>

&lt;p>“The summer I sang the lead for Annie it was 1999. My father was in serious preparedness mode. Not since I was five, and the Weavers were under siege, had he been so certain that the Days of Abomination were upon us.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dad called it Y2K. On January 1, he said, computer systems all over the world would fail. There would be no electricity, no telephones. All would sink into chaos, and this would usher in the Second Coming of Christ.
”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Can’t they fix it?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Nope, can’t be done,” Dad said. “Man trusted his own strength, and his strength was weak.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;p>“I’d never learned how to talk to people who weren’t like us—people who went to school and visited the doctor. Who weren’t preparing, every day, for the End of the World. Worm Creek was full of these people, people whose words seemed ripped from another reality. That was how it felt the first time the director spoke to me, like he was speaking from another dimension. All he said was, “Go find FDR.” I didn’t move.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He tried again. “President Roosevelt. FDR.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Is that like a JCB?” I said. “You need a forklift?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Everyone laughed.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h3 id="a-friend-called-charlies">A friend called Charlies&lt;/h3>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“I’m Charles,” he said. There was a pause while he waited for me to give my name, but I didn’t. “I saw you in the last play,” he said after a moment. “I wanted to tell you something.” I braced myself, for what I wasn’t sure, then he said, “I wanted to tell you that your singing is about the best I ever heard.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Maybe,” I said, and he smiled. A few of his friends stepped into the wing and called to him. He stood and said goodbye, and I watched him join them, taking in the easy way they joked together and imagining an alternate reality in which I was one of them. I imagined Charles inviting me to his house, to play a game or watch a movie, and felt a rush of pleasure. But when I pictured Charles visiting Buck’s Peak, I felt something else, something like panic. What if he found the root cellar? What if he discovered the fuel tank? Then I understood, finally, what the rifle was for. That mighty barrel, with its special range that could reach from the mountain to the valley, was a defensive perimeter for the house, for our supplies, because Dad said we would be driving when everyone else was hotfooting it. We would have food, too, when everyone else was starving, looting. Again I imagined Charles climbing the hill to our house. But in my imagination I was on the ridge, and I was watching his approach through crosshairs.”&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I waited for the screen to flicker and die. I was trying to take it all in, this last, luxurious moment—of sharp yellow light, of warm air flowing from the heater. I was experiencing nostalgia for the life I’d had before, which I would lose at any second, when the world turned and began to devour itself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The longer I sat motionless, breathing deeply, trying to inhale the last scent of the fallen world, the more I resented its continuing solidity. […] Sometime after 1:30 I went to bed. I glimpsed Dad as I left, his face frozen in the dark, the light from the TV leaping across his square glasses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He seemed smaller to me than he had that morning. The disappointment in his features was so childlike, for a moment I wondered how God could deny him this. He, a faithful servant, who suffered willingly just as Noah had willingly suffered to build the ark.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But God withheld the flood.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>“According to Grandma, a hundred years ago a tribe of Apaches had fought the U.S. Cavalry on those faded rocks. The tribe was outnumbered: the battle lost, the war over. All that was left to do was wait to die. Soon after the battle began, the warriors became trapped on a ledge. Unwilling to suffer a humiliating defeat, cut down one by one as they tried to break through the cavalry, they mounted their horses and charged off the face of the mountain. When the Apache women found their broken bodies on the rocks below, they cried huge, desperate tears, which turned to stone when they touched the earth.”&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="q1-how-did-motherfatherme-get-changed-while-mother-became-a-midwife">Q1: How did Mother/father/me get changed while mother became a midwife?&lt;/h2>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Midwifing changed my mother. She was a grown woman with seven children, but this was the first time in her life that she was, without question or caveat, the one in charge. Sometimes, in the days after a birth, I detected in her something of Judy’s heavy presence, in a forceful turn of her head, or the imperious arch of an eyebrow. She stopped wearing makeup, then she stopped apologizing for not wearing it.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>At the beginning, very exhausted&lt;/li>
&lt;li>acted as an assistant&lt;/li>
&lt;li>acted as a midwife herself&lt;/li>
&lt;li>income/money to afford the telephone&lt;/li>
&lt;li>not so boring, help people&lt;/li>
&lt;li>cheaper but illegal&lt;/li>
&lt;li>only in charge&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Offered such a job under such circumstances, accept or not?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>age: 30 or 40 year-old?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>7 children, baby&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Her father really force her mother to work&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As long as we have income, then nobody can force us&lt;/li>
&lt;li>hesitated to make a change&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Every child is different&lt;/li>
&lt;li>stable&lt;/li>
&lt;li>She worked a housewife&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Why did she married such a kind of guy?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>妇产科 （Obstetrics and Gynecology） vs . Midwife&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Harvard Positive Psychology&lt;/li>
&lt;li>survivalist&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Dad stood there for several seconds, his mouth open. Of course a midwife needs a phone, he said. Then he went back to the junkyard and that’s all that was ever said about it. We hadn’t had a telephone for as long as I could remember, but the next day there it was, resting in a lime-green cradle, its glossy finish looking out of place next to the murky jars of cohosh and skullcap.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>She barked orders and we moved wordlessly to follow them. The baby was born without complications. It was mythic and romantic, being an intimate witness to this turn in life’s cycle, but Mother had been right, I didn’t like it. It was long and exhausting, and smelled of groin sweat.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="q2-how-can-we-learn-from-the-midwife-story-to-make-a-change-in-our-life">Q2: How can we learn from the midwife story to make a change in our life?&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Money is the most important thing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you earn above an amount, doesn&amp;rsquo;t make a different. (Survey)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How to spend the money? For eating or helping others&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The next time the midwife came she brought her daughter Maria, who stood next to her mother, imitating her movements, with a baby wedged against her wiry nine-year-old frame. I stared hopefully at her. I hadn’t met many other girls like me, who didn’t go to school. I edged closer, trying to draw her attention, but she was wholly absorbed in listening to her mother, who was explaining how cramp bark and motherwort should be administered to treat post-birth contractions. Maria’s head bobbed in agreement; her eyes never left her mother’s face.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>THERE WERE NO HERBALISTS in Wyoming as good as Mother, so a few months after the incident at the hospital, Judy came to Buck’s Peak to restock. The two women chatted in the kitchen, Judy perched on a barstool, Mother leaning across the counter, her head resting lazily in her hand. I took the list of herbs to the storeroom.

&lt;li>It should be fairly easy (and fun) to read: Improving your English doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be a chore. In fact, if you choose something you&amp;rsquo;d like to read, you&amp;rsquo;re more like to stick to it.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>You Look Like a Thing and I Love You: How Artificial Intelligence Works and Why It&amp;rsquo;s Making the World a Weirder Place is a 2019 nonfiction book by optics research scientist Janelle Shane. The book documents experiences the author and others have had with machine learning programs, and discusses what &amp;ldquo;intelligence&amp;rdquo; means in the context of &amp;ldquo;artificial intelligence&amp;rdquo; (AI).[1]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A reviewer in the Christian Science Monitor found the book &amp;ldquo;eye-opening&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;fun&amp;rdquo;, stating &amp;ldquo;I found this book comforting: Shane makes a convincing case that AI isn&amp;rsquo;t going to be stealing jobs in the near future.&amp;quot;[1] A review in ZDNet called the book &amp;ldquo;approachable&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;insightful&amp;rdquo;.[3] A capsule review in the Philadelphia Inquirer called Shane a &amp;ldquo;great guide&amp;rdquo;,[4] and a capsule review in Publishers Weekly called the book an &amp;ldquo;accessible primer&amp;rdquo; with &amp;ldquo;charming&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;often-hilarious&amp;rdquo; content.[5] A reviewer in E&amp;amp;T judged the book &amp;ldquo;stands out for Shane&amp;rsquo;s madcap sense of humour and affection for the subject&amp;rdquo;.[6] In The Verge, a December 2019 list of &amp;ldquo;the 11 best new sci-fi books&amp;rdquo; included Shane&amp;rsquo;s book, stating &amp;ldquo;Science fact, rather than science fiction, (the book is) incredibly informative&amp;rdquo;.[7] A similar list in Ars Technica praised that &amp;ldquo;anybody, not just the engineer-minded or the tech-savvy, can understand the often abstract concepts she details.&amp;quot;[8] The book also made Scientific American&amp;rsquo;s list of &amp;ldquo;Recommended Books&amp;rdquo; for November 2019.[9]&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In this smart, often hilarious introduction to the most interesting science of our time, Shane shows how these programs learn, fail, and adapt—and how they reflect the best and worst of humanity.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>We are what we read, according to Robert DiYanni. Reading may delight us or move us; we may read for instruction or inspiration. But more than this, in reading we discover ourselves. We gain access to the lives of others, explore the limitless possibilities of human existence, develop our understanding of the world around us, and find respite from the hectic demands of everyday life. In You Are What You Read, DiYanni provides a practical guide that shows how we can increase the benefits and pleasures of reading literature by becoming more skillful and engaged readers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>DiYanni suggests that we attend first to what authors say and the way in which they say it, rather than rushing to decide what they mean. He considers the various forms of literature, from the essay to the novel, the short story to the poem, demonstrating rewarding approaches to each in sample readings of classic works. Through a series of illuminating oppositions, he explores the paradoxical pleasures of reading: solitary versus social reading, submitting to or resisting the author, reading inwardly or outwardly, and more. DiYanni closes with nine recommended reading practices, thoughts on the different experiences of print and digital reading, and advice on what to read and why.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Robert DiYanni’s You Are What You Read is an ardent, well-conceived guide to how readers can improve their experience of a diverse range of literary texts. At a time when skepticism about the humanities abounds, DiYanni offers a valuable window into the ways our inner lives flourish and expand under the influence of poetry, fiction, and nonfiction prose.”—David Haven Blake, author of Walt Whitman and the Culture of American Celebrity&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Mr. Penumbra&amp;rsquo;s 24-Hour Bookstore is a 2012 novel by American writer Robin Sloan. It was chosen as one of the best 100 books of 2012 by the San Francisco Chronicle,[1] was a New York Times Editor&amp;rsquo;s Choice,[2] and was on the New York Times Hardcover Fiction Best Seller list[3] as well as the NPR Hardcover Fiction Bestseller List.[4] The US book cover, which glows in the dark, was done by Rodrigo Corral and chosen as one of the 25 best book covers for 2012 by BookPage.[5][6][7]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mr. Penumbra&amp;rsquo;s 24-Hour Bookstore combines elements of fantasy, mystery, friendship and adventure as a way of looking at the modern conflict and transition between new technology (electronic) and old (print books). The protagonist (主角) is a laid-off Silicon Valley tech worker who begins working at a dusty bookstore with very few customers, only to start discovering one secret after another. The mysterious old books, along with the store&amp;rsquo;s owner, lead to a 500-year-old secret society.[8]&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Great Recession has shuffled Clay Jannon out of his life as a San Francisco Web-design drone—and serendipity(机缘巧合), sheer curiosity, and the ability to climb a ladder like a monkey has landed him a new gig（工作） working the night shift at Mr. Penumbra&amp;rsquo;s 24-Hour Bookstore. But after just a few days on the job, Clay begins to realize that this store is even more curious than the name suggests. There are only a few customers, but they come in repeatedly and never seem to actually buy anything, instead &amp;ldquo;checking out&amp;rdquo; impossibly obscure volumes from strange corners of the store, all according to some elaborate, long-standing arrangement with the gnomic（深奥的） Mr. Penumbra. The store must be a front for something larger, Clay concludes, and soon he&amp;rsquo;s embarked on a complex analysis of the customers' behavior and roped his friends into helping to figure out just what&amp;rsquo;s going on. But once they bring their findings to Mr. Penumbra, it turns out the secrets extend far outside the walls of the bookstore.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian is a humorous novel by Marina Lewycka, first published in 2005 by Viking (Penguin Books).[1]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The novel describes the reactions of two daughters when their widowed, 84-year-old father Nikolai marries a highly sexual and much younger Ukrainian immigrant, Valentina. Concerned about Valentina’s motives, Nadezhda and Vera are drawn back into contact with each other after a long period of estrangement (疏远). They find themselves united against a common enemy in Valentina, whose grasping, manipulative behavior escalates until the daughters finally succeed in obtaining a divorce for their father.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Polish translator and travel writer Magda Healey, reviewing the book for Bookbag, thought it &amp;ldquo;eminently(非常) readable, well flowing and colourful&amp;rdquo;, though it showed a common fault of autobiographical debut novels, with too much content crammed in, the stories often not thoroughly explored. All the same, it had moving moments, some poetically beautiful passages, and &amp;ldquo;wonderfully absurd&amp;rdquo; scenes of farce. She found the sections of the engineer Nikolai&amp;rsquo;s monumental history of tractors &amp;ldquo;a nice device&amp;rdquo;. It was undemanding &amp;ldquo;but not totally shallow&amp;rdquo;.[4]&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Award-winning writer Tanika Gupta has created a wonderful re-telling of this dark family comedy, adapted from the bestselling novel by Marina Lewycka for the stage. It explores the hopes and hardships of immigrants, and how past experiences can shape families and relationships.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Right: fucking bastards. Except to Adrian, who listened to our denunciations, but rarely joined in. And yet, it seemed to us, he had more cause than most. His mother had walked out years before, leaving his dad to cope with Adrian and his sister. This was long before the term ‘single-parent family’ came into use; back then it was ‘a broken home’, and Adrian was the only person we knew who came from one. This ought to have given him a whole storetank of existential rage, but somehow it didn’t; he said he loved his mother and respected his father. Privately, the three of us examined his case and came up with a theory: that the key to a happy family life was for there not to be a family – or at least, not one living together. Having made this analysis, we envied Adrian the more.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Tony get divorced, and felt lonely
Platonic girlfriends
Received a letter from a lawyer&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tony &amp;amp; Veronica
Veronica&amp;rsquo;s mother
Adrian: committed suicide&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>we make an instinctive decision, then build up an infrastructure of reasoning to justify it. And call the result common sense. Did I think Adrian’s action an implied criticism of the rest of us?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Memory differs from the old facts/reality
cowardice / peaceable
keeping diary&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Or perhaps it’s that same paradox again: the history that happens underneath our noses ought to be the clearest, and yet it’s the most deliquescent. We live in time, it bounds us and defines us, and time is supposed to measure history, isn’t it? But if we can’t understand time, can’t grasp its mysteries of pace and progress, what chance do we have with history – even our own small, personal, largely undocumented piece of it?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>And it ought to be obvious to us that time doesn’t act as a fixative, rather as a solvent. But it’s not convenient – it’s not useful – to believe this; it doesn’t help us get on with our lives; so we ignore it.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>The mother looks very different;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>One evidence by the author “This is my principal factual memory…” that the memory might be very different with the fact. So the reader should be very skeptical to what we read in this part.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Looks like Veronica is not treating Tony not very well. Veronica didn’t kiss Tony good evening. Join their examination. This might because Tony hate Veronica because Veronica went out with Adrian.&lt;/li>
